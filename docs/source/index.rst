Welcome to PyWinCFFI's documentation!
=====================================

This library is a wrapper around some Windows functions using Python
and CFFI.  The repository was originally created to assist the Twisted
project in moving away from pywin32 so installation does not require a compile
step.

For more information, see the sections below for the module index.

    Add a few sections to supplement/expand on what's in the README.
